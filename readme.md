# Final Project
hellloooooooooooo hackers this the repo for our project (isa nsmeeh b3deen)

make sure to revise the git workflow we talked about (below a simple example)

and the frontend work will be [here](./client) while the backend [here](./server/)

## GitHub Workflow Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.

2. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes using the `git checkout -b` command.

3. **Make Changes**: Make the necessary changes to the files in your local repository.

4. **Stage and Commit**: Stage the changes using the `git add` command, followed by committing the changes using the `git commit` command.

5. **Push Changes**: Push the committed changes to the remote repository using the `git push` command.

6. **Create a Pull Request**: Create a pull request on GitHub to propose your changes to the repository's main branch.

7. **Review and Merge**: Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by other contributors. Once approved, the changes can be merged into the main branch.

8. **Resolve Conflicts**: If there are any conflicts during the merge process, resolve them by carefully reviewing and modifying the affected files.

9. **Test and Verify**: After the changes are merged, test and verify that everything is working as expected.

10. **Delete Branch**: Once the changes are successfully merged, delete the branch using the `git branch -d` command.
