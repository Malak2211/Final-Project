        <h1>WORKOUT TRACKER</h1>
        <p>
          Progress can be tracked in several ways and is completely your
          preference. It is a good idea to write down weights and repetitions to
          track your progress - this can also help you to keep your motivation
          up and to build a good habit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below you can plan or track your workouts per week and you can also
          add other forms of training, such as walking, running, or a group
          class if you want.
        </p>
        <p>We hope you have fun during this journey!</p>
